                <div class="storyText">
                    <p> When I started secondary school, I got in touch with programming. I instantly found this very rewarding and really enjoyed doing it. So I started to build my own small robots at home. Later I switched from building robots to things I use every day like building my own smarthome devices. Today, I am more passionate then ever about programming, problemsolving and optimising things. My latest passion is Artificial Intelligence and I am even a student Applied Information Technology in AI at Hogeschool PXL. This is for from the only thing PXL has learned me. <br>Please scroll further to discover the extra activities I have done.</p>
